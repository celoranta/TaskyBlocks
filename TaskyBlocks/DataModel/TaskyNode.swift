   isCollapsed:  It can apply to a task when shown under one parent, yet not apply to the same task when shown under another parent.  This needs to be saved between sessions and regraphings
   Sibling Order: It can apply to a task when shown under one parent, yet apply differently to the same task when shown under another parent.  This needs to be saved between sessions and regraphings.
