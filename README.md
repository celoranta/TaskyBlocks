# TaskyBlocks

TaskyBlocks is a personal planner and self-help iOS application focused on simplifying the basic tenets of project management and value-guided action into a graphics-based personal tool.  

TaskyBlocks allows for quick-yet-thorough prioritization of related tasks, ultimately based on the values of the user.  Once tasks have been prioritized, TaskyBlocks encourages the completion of these tasks using timed pomodoro sessions.

Wherever possible, user assignment of 'flags' and number values have been replaced with the interactive arrangement of graphical "task blocks," which auto-calculate task priority based on their placement in relation to one other.  

The end goal of TaskyBlocks is to keep people focused on healthy productive actions, encourage the completion of meaningful, potent goals, and thus improve the quality of life of the user.

## Getting Started

TaskyBlocks is written in Swift 4 using Xcode 9.  The GitHub repository includes any and all required APIs.  As with all Xcode proejcts, a Mac running a recent operating system and Xcode is required to compile the code.  

### Prerequisites

Apart from a Mac computer running Xcode 9, there are no prerequisites.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests
